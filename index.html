        Here are some of Taylor's amazing lyrics:
        I walked through the door with you
        The air was cold
        But something about it felt like home somehow
        And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
        And you've still got it in your drawer even now
        Oh, your sweet disposition
        And my wide-eyed gaze
        We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
        Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
        And I can picture it after all these days
        And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
        And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
        'Cause there we are again on that little town street
        You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
        Wind in my hair, I was there
        I remember it all too well
      </p>
